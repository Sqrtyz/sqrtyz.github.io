Hello! I am Yuzhuo Tian, currently an undergraduate student from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My primary research focus on **computer vision and spatial intelligence**, I am also open to and interested in some other fields like robotics and VLA model.

I am fortunate to conduct research in State Key Lab of CAD&CG with research professor [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/) and X-D Lab with assistant professor [Yiyi Liao](https://yiyiliao.github.io/) previously. Currently, I am doing an internship about 3D mapping at [AI4CE Lab, New York University](https://ai4ce.github.io/) led by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng).

My goal is to explore the limits of how artificial intelligence models understand the visual world, and furthermore, try to apply the visual understanding to agent's decision in real life.
