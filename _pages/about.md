Hello! I am Yuzhuo Tian, currently an undergraduate student from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) majoring in Computer Science and Technology. At the same time, I am also pursuing a minor in [ACEE program](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/34924/list.htm) at [Chu Kochen Honer College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/). My primary research focus on **computer vision and spatial intelligence**, especially on 3D Reconstruction, SLAM and Spatial Reasoning. I am also open to some other fields like robotics (VLA model) and world model. My long-term goal is to develop the full-stack intelligent agent with spatial intelligence, which is capable of perceiving the scene, reasoning about its content, and acting within it.

I am fortunate to conduct research in State Key Lab of CAD&CG with research professor [Hao Chen](https://stan-haochen.github.io/) and X-D Lab with assistant professor [Yiyi Liao](https://yiyiliao.github.io/) previously. Currently, I am doing an internship about 3D mapping at [AI4CE Lab, New York University](https://ai4ce.github.io/) led by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng).

You can view my CV [here](https://sqrtyz.github.io/assets/pdf/Resume-yuzhuo.pdf) (Updated on Dec. 29 2025).
